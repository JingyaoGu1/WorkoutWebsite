# WorkoutWebsite
This website is inspired by the Youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpqoZQ8GNK8&t=2387s. The video is designed to teach viewers some REACT knowledge.

I added two different sections. Data is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drmkgray/workout-data

First is a filter and search section where users can select equipment type, difficulty level, and body part from the three drop down menus and the corresponding workouts will be displayed in a table format.

Second is an AI powered section to auto generate workouts based on user attributes like age, height, weight and experience level.
Here are the more detailed steps:
### 1. Data preprocessinng
### 2. Select relevant user and dataset features and combine
### 3. Perform one-hot encoding and standardize features
### 4. Perform PCA for dimensionality reduction
### 5. Determine optimal number of clusters using silhouette score
### 6. Perform clustering with optimal number of clusters(KNN)
### 7. Recommend workouts based on user attributes
